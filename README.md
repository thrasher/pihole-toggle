# Pi-hole Toggle

This script uses the state of a toggle switch to enable or disable the pi-hole ad blocker.
This allows people to control ad-blocking by flipping the toggle switch.
In some cases, this may make websites or other infrastucture (looking at you Peloton GUI) to behave differently because of access to trackers.
